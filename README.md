# Fillydelphia Prototype - CANCELLED #

**You know, this is funny. This project has been started 3 times since the end 2018, and after each time I got some time consuming offer you just can't say no to. Unfortunately, the project is impossible without dedicating at least 4 hrs a day. Thus, I declare the idea cursed and promise to never ever return to it again. Sorry to those who were involved.**  
**- Shimmermare.**

A project aimed to create a prototype of a top-down shooter RPG in the setting of Fallout: Equestria. 

The prototype uses **Unity 2020.1** game engine. That means we use new shiny things such as **Universal Render Pipeline**, **Shader Graph**, **C# 7.3**, new **InputSystem** and so on.
