## Chronology ##
+ Built under a little village called Our Town, near the [Old Olneigh]. The mayor of the town was appointed as the overmare.

+ After The Last Day, nearly half of the stable population were Our Town residents, and the other half were miners from nearby gem mines.

+ Miners were not happy about the stable's experiment of cutiemark rejection, and unhappiness grew.

+ The breaking point was when a little filly got her cutiemark, and just minutes later Starlight Glimmer forcefully took it away.

+ Ponies divided, and blood was spilled shortly. Rebels attacked security and tried to get into armory, but were pushed back.

+ Some of the rebels were pushed to the reactor level, while others trapped in Depot.

+ A carelessly thrown hand grenade damaged the stable reactor, and it was automatically shutdown.

+ High levels of magic radiation contaminated the stable. Ponies who were nearby the accident died in a matter of hours.

+ Medical ward didn't have enough Rad-Away for everypony, and soon ponies started to show radiation poisoning symptoms.

+ The overmare ordered to open up depot, but stable walls were too much for weakened workers.

+ Rebels heard on broadcast how the overmare was more crazy with each passing day.

+ When her broadcast has ended and rebels thought that everypony died, they unsealed themselves and tried to make a way out of the stable.

+ But instead of halls full of corpses they found a horde of undead, with Starlight as the only capable of speech.

+ They did it to entrance, but failed to open the door because they had no code.

+ Once their barricades were shattered and they were out of ammo - ghouls tore them to pieces.
