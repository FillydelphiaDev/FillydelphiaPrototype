You are a mercenary hired by [The Twilight Society] to find the Cutietron-3000 in [The Stable 55][Stable 55].

### Act 1: Entrance ###

You're slowly walking through the cavern. The floor is full of old skeletons of those who couldn't make it in time or failed to get a place in the shelter. No matter how careful you are, the sounds of crushing bones are following your steps. In the end of the hall, you see a massive, gear-like stable door with "55" engraved on it.  

![Stable 55: Outside](References/Stable55CavernWithSkeletons.jpg)

The only source of light in the cave (besides the dim glow of your [PipBuck]) is a red light on a battered console. Despite the desperate tries of ponies laying here to open the door, [Stable-Tec] equipment is proven reliable once again. You connect your [PipBuck] to the console, and after one command the door slowly slides inside and to the left, dust clouds and rattles of metal accompanying it.  

[PipBuck]'s magic radiation detector immediately starts to click. As you eye the room lit only by the red glow of emergency lights, you  see signs of a failed defense: shattered barricades, empty ammo boxes and skeletons in stable uniform. Defenders had no chance - they were attacked from all sides, and had no way to open the gear door.  
What's strange here is that there's no bullet marks from enemy's fire, like attackers used bare hooves. There's only two possible explanations: either this stable's experiment is mandatory unarmed combat training, or... your thought was interrupted by piercing screech from somewhere inside the stable. Doesn't matter what you expected, but now you know that this search won't be an easy one - red dots appearing at the corner of your eyes confirm that.  

### Act 2: Way to Atrium ###

Your fast way to the overmare's office is blocked: door to the atrium is locked down and elevator is not in working condition lightly speaking. Unfortunately, you don't know nearly enough **hacking** or **repair** to open the door or to fix the elevator. That leaves you with the only possible way: into the utility areas.  

Just as you enter utility you see a ghoul slowly walking away from you until he's around the corner. You proceed to carefully inspect the rooms. You have to take down individual ghouls as you moving between rooms. So far all loot you found was industrial junk and other scrap.  

You found a locked door. Thankfully, you know basic lockpicking. There is a terminal on the table, and a dead pony in front of it. Green glow from the terminal illuminated the skeleton. On the floor lies a revolver with 5 of the 6 bullets loaded - it's obvious that this pony commited suicide. The terminal had password simple enough for you to hack it. Beside work correspondence there is a recording. You download it to your [PipBuck].  

*This is over... When security trapped rebels on reactor level, someone thrown a grenade at the reactor. PipBuck constantly crackling - how the fuck do I turn it off?! Overmare says that we need a little bit more time and we'll manage to get into the depot. But I know that this is bullshit. Ruby said that she heard how doctors said that everypony in the stable already got lethal dose of radiation. And even if we take away all that Rad-Away from rebels, how long we'll manage? A year? A month? There's hundreds of ponies for Celestia sake!*  
*Ponies who was there when the reactor was damaged are already dead. My fur and mane fell out yesterday. I'm bleeding everywhere. The food I eat ended on the floor. Tartarus. I don't want to suffer...*  

![RED_SQUARE] TODO: Reference art of a pony skeleton at the table with a terminal on the table.  

You stumble upon an open door leading to reactor. Radiation levels increased as you come closer. All you see inside is a collapsed tunnel. There's no way further. You also saw a door to storage section, but it was locked from the other side. After a few dead ghouls, you reached the door to atrium.  

### Act 3: Atrium ###

![RED_SQUARE] TODO: Player clears atrium from ghouls; checks on medical ward with a terminal with records, and living quarters with cafeteria, school with tons of propaganda, and some stories inside.  

### Act 4: Security ###

![RED_SQUARE] TODO: Player checks on security and finds notes about their response to the coup. Also, player optionally checks on Armory, until finally going for overmare's office. Her terminal contains instructions for overmare from Stable-Tec, Starlight's thoughts on various things including the coup attempt, and command to open the tunnel to cutiemark storage. Player can't activate it, because there's not enough power. Now player is asked to turn on the reactor. The only way to reactor is through storage.  

### Act 5: Road to Reactor ###

![RED_SQUARE] TODO: You go through the gardens until you reach storage. Door, surprisingly, is open. There is signs of cut-in attempt. Player finds out that rebels inside waited until everyone outside died and made an attempt to leave the stable.  

### Act 6: Bringing Power ###

![RED_SQUARE] TODO: Reactor level is time-based. You turn on the reactor in two stages, with a mini boss battle with The Glowing One in between.  

### Act 7: The Overmare ###

![RED_SQUARE] TODO: After player returns to the Overmare's office, he notices that there's new note on the terminal. It's from Starlight, and she says that she's waiting for player in the cutiemark storage. Player needs to defeat the overmare to win the game.
