You are a mercenary hired by [The Twilight Society] to find the Cutietron-3000 in [The Stable 55][Stable 55].

### Act 1: Intro ###

You're slowly walking through the cavern. The floor is full of old skeletons of those who couldn't make it in time or failed to get a place in the shelter. No matter how careful you are, the sounds of crushing bones are following your steps. In the end of the hall, you see a massive, gear-like stable door with "55" engraved on it.  

![RED_SQUARE] TODO: Insert reference art of a cavern full of pony skeletons

The only source of light in the cave (besides the dim glow of your [PipBuck]) is a red light on a battered console. Despite the desperate tries of ponies laying here to open the door, [Stable-Tec] equipment is proven reliable once again. You connect your [PipBuck] to the console, and after one command the door slowly slides inside and to the left, dust clouds and rattles of metal accompanying it.

![RED_SQUARE] TODO: Insert reference art of stable door opening.

[PipBuck]'s magic radiation detector immediately starts to click. As you eye the room lit only by the red glow of emergency lights, you immediately see signs of an old battle: covers, ammo boxes, bullet marks and skeletons in stable uniform. Defenders had no chance - they were attacked from all sides, and had no way to open the gear door.  
Judging by the fact that winners didn't remove the bodies, there's only two possible explanations: either everyone is dead, or... your thought was interrupted by piercing screech from somewhere inside the stable. Doesn't matter what you expected, but now you know that this search won't be an easy one - red dots appearing at the corner of your eyes confirm that.

### Act 2: Overmare's Office ###

![RED_SQUARE] TODO: Player makes his way to Overmare's office, killing some ghouls on the way. Player can't open the passage to the cutiemark storage room because there's no power. Now player needs to turn on the reactor.

### Act 3: Reactor ###

![RED_SQUARE] TODO: Reactor level is time-based. In the reactor room player is attacked by The Glowing One. 

### Act 4: The Overmare ###

![RED_SQUARE] TODO: After player returns to the Overmare's office, he notices that there's new note on the terminal. It's from Starlight, and she says that she's waiting for player in the cutiemark storage. Player needs to defeat the overmare to win the game.
